This is an colaboration work of me(Phuong Pham) and Matthew Nazari to have a fun project with chipotle.
We both works at chipotle and want to increase our store rating by doing the survey on our own.
This script automate the process of doing the survey, which is tedios and take a lot of times. 

The project using selenium as the engine to run on the chrome browser. The script takes the input, which is the survey code, from the text file to do the survey.
When the survey is finished, the script will continue on the next input until it reaches the end of text file.
